Off - No APB
Soft Anti-Pass back - Log the violation, grant a cardholder access
Hard Anti-Pass back - Log the violation, deny cardholder access"
Timed Anti pass back ,"The functionality of anti-pass back is based on the rule of the in-out-in-out-in-out pattern. If the user flashes his card on the in-reader and passes his card to his friend to use it again for the in-reader or flashes the card twice on the reader, it will create the pattern of in-in, which will activate the anti-pass back rule, and access will be denied. Timed anti-pass back signifies that a designated amount of time must pass before an access card may be used at the same reader again."

Notes: 
1. Timed anti-pass back is independent of the adjacent controller group.
2. For timed anti-pass back, the 'Time Out' value is compulsory.
3. Timeout is time in seconds to lockout users if they represent their card.
4. The timeout timer begins with a card read and counts down to 0. Once the timer hits 0, a user can once again gain access.
5. Timeout time ranges between 0 to 65535 seconds.
6. Timed Anti-pass back is also configurable to the response when someone violates the lockout time. The following are the options:
7. Off - No APB (default)
8. Reader Based - prevent the same card from allowing consecutive access within a specified time.
9. User Based - prevent the same card from allowing non-consecutive access at the same reader within a specified time.
10. Real and Timed anti-pass back are mutually exclusive, i.e one reader can be configured as either real or timed anti-pass back.

Use Case: -                                                           
Less debounce time is highly sensitive that gives instant input activation status. More debounce time is less sensitive but will give accurate input activation status and will ignore any fluctuations.
"
Hold time in Input Parameters,"Time taken to get Input deactivated status in the device/software after the Input is actually deactivated in real world.Time ranging from 2 to 15 (in seconds).    
                                       
Use Case: -                            
Less hold time is highly sensitive that gives instant input deactivation status. More hold time is less sensitive but will give accurate input deactivation status and will ignore any fluctuations.
"
Open all doors in Input Parameters,"This option can be set to send signals to the doors to perform the necessary command such as No, Close on Event Close, and Manual Close. If you choose No, it means that the doors will remain closes against the triggered Input. With Close on Event Close, which is server-based, the doors will close once the event alarm sets off after a specified time. With the Manual close option, the doors are to be closed manually once the event alarm sets off.
